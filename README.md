# Hands on Git Hub

This repository is meant to provide a short introduction to GitHub in an informal way. It is tailored for the different activities that we run in the lab rather than as a course. 

The readme file will point to existing popular resources such as [Git Hub skills](https://github.com/skills).

<summary><h2>How are GitHub accounts organized</h2></summary>

  - **Personal GitHub account**: is unique and the owner of the account is the only one who can manage it. A personal account can have both private and public repositories. In the free version, each personal account can have a personal webpage built on top of GitHub pages. 

  - **GitHub organizations**: Shared accounts where the lab (Henriques' lab) and open-source projects (BioImage.IO, Fiji, ImageJ2) can collaborate across many projects at once, with sophisticated security and administrative features. Teams usually work within organisations as it serves as a container for shared work and gives the work a unique name and brand.

Usually an organisation looks like this:

We can always see in the user's profile if they are part of any public organization:

<summary><h2>When do we use GitHub?</h2></summary>

### Examples of GitHub usage in the lab or in science:
- Collaborative or individual software projects (NanoJ, ZeroCostDL4Mic, BioImage Model Zoo, deepImageJ...)
- Methods (scripts for data analysis, pipelines, software components of a book chapter)
- Webpages
- Paper writting (*e.g.*, connect with Overleaf)
- Course materials
- Slides if they are programmable (ImJoy slides)

### GitHub is NOT 
- A data storage

<summary><h2>What do you need to start?</h2></summary>

 - **Create a GitHub (https://github.com/) account**. The email can be changed in the future. It might be interesting to sign up as a member from an academical institution.
 - **Install Git locally**. Follow the guidelines [here](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

<summary><h1>Tips building up a documented coding repository</h1></summary>

- Name: avoid using underscores (`_`) in the name. Changing the name of a repository in the future is not recommendable as all the links depend on this naming so take some time to think about it.
- Public/Private: this is personal and depends on each project. Any of the choices are reversible.
- README.md: It is the first thing that anyone will see when entering in your repo. It can be the main entry to the documentation of your code or the source to link other resources (webpages, wiki). It is a good place to link the code with any existing reference and to indicate how to cite the work.
- .gitignore: it tells git which files or folders should not be tracked.
- License: If you are developing some code that is expected to be public in the future, you shoudl always care about its license. GitHub has already the templates for many different licenses. The most common ones for open source are MIT, BSL3-Clause, BSL2-Clause, but the are plenty of them.
