# Hands on Git Hub

This repository is meant to provide a short introduction to GitHub in an informal way. It is tailored for the different activities that we run in the lab rather than as a course. 

The readme file will point to existing popular resources such as [Git Hub skills](https://github.com/skills).

<summary><h2>How are GitHub accounts organized</h2></summary>

  - **Personal GitHub account**: is unique and the owner of the account is the only one who can manage it. A personal account can have both private and public repositories. In the free version, each personal account can have a personal webpage built on top of GitHub pages. 

  - **GitHub organizations**: Shared accounts where the lab (Henriques' lab) and open-source projects (BioImage.IO, Fiji, ImageJ2) can collaborate across many projects at once, with sophisticated security and administrative features. Teams usually work within organisations as it serves as a container for shared work and gives the work a unique name and brand.

Usually an organisation looks like this:

We can always see in the user's profile if they are part of any public organization:

- Methods (scripts for data analysis, pipelines, software components of a book chapter)
- Webpages
- Paper writting (*e.g.*, connect with Overleaf)
- Course materials
- Slides if they are programmable (ImJoy slides)
